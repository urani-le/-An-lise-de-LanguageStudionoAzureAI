Immunotherapy outcomes are closely linked to the seven steps of 
Cancer-Immunity Cycle as proposed by Chen, Coukos and Mellman. 
According to this cycle, cancer cell eradication by the immune cells is a 
stepwise process beginning with cancer immune recognition and 
mounting of an adaptive immune response, to cancer cell elimination; 
each of them represents an eligible target for treatment, as well as a 
potential strategy for cancer immune escape [1]. In this context in-
hibition of PD-1/L1 checkpoint axis using monoclonal antibodies 
(mAbs) has shown a well-established efficacy in the treatment of nu-
merous cancer types including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma 
(HNSCC) and has found wide clinical application in recent years, while 
novel approaches using combinations of checkpoint inhibitors with 
radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy, cytokine-based and/or adoptive T
cell therapies are investigated in ongoing clinical trials
